Laplacian Mesh Deformation
==========================

Deforming a 3D surface mesh while preserving its local detail is useful for
editing anatomical atlases or for mesh based segmentation. This contribution
introduces new classes for performing *hard* and *soft constraints* deformation
in a flexible design which allows user to switch easily in between Laplacian
discretization operators, area weighing and solvers. The usage of these new
classes is demonstrated on a sphere.
